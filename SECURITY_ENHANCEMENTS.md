- ✅ Proper token validation in authentication

### 8. **Account Management**
- ✅ Added account activation/deactivation support
- ✅ Email verification requirement before login
- ✅ Proper user status checking during login

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks
3. **Email Verification**: Ensures email ownership
4. **Strong Passwords**: Enforces complex password requirements
5. **Unique Constraints**: Prevents duplicate accounts
6. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information leakage
7. **Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
8. **Data Sanitization**: Automatic trimming and case normalization

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. **Email Service Integration**: Replace console logging with actual email service (SendGrid, AWS SES)
2. **Password Reset**: Implement secure password reset functionality
3. **Account Lockout**: Add temporary account lockout after multiple failed attempts
4. **2FA**: Consider implementing two-factor authentication
5. **Session Management**: Add refresh token functionality
6. **Audit Logging**: Enhanced security audit trails
7. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure all communications are encrypted
8. **Environment Variables**: Move all secrets to environment variables

## Testing

After implementing these changes, test the following scenarios:

1. Register with weak password (should fail)
2. Register with invalid email format (should fail)
3. Register with duplicate email/phone (should fail)
4. Login without email verification (should fail)
5. Multiple rapid login attempts (should be rate limited)
6. Email verification flow (should work)
7. Valid registration and login (should work)

## Configuration Required

Update your `.env` file with:
```
JWT_SECRET=your-strong-jwt-secret-here
EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=your-email-service-key
```

All security enhancements are now in place and your authentication system is significantly more secure!
